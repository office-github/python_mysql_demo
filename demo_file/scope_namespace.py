# The output of the example code is:
#
# After local assignment: test spam
# After nonlocal assignment: nonlocal spam
# After global assignment: nonlocal spam
# In global scope: global spam
# Note how the local assignment (which is default) didn’t change scope_test’s binding of spam.
# The nonlocal assignment changed scope_test’s binding of spam, and the global assignment changed the module-level binding.
